>Please provide a list of all deliverables for the milestone and include links to the actual deliverables.

>Ideally all links inside the table below should include a commit hash, which will be used for testing. If you don't provide a commit hash, we will work off the default branch of your repository. Thus, if you plan on continuing work after delivery, we suggest you create a separate branch for either the delivery or your continuing work.

>If there is anything particular about any of the deliverables we or a future reader should know, use the respective Notes column.
